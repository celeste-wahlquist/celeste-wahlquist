👋 Hi, I’m Celeste

When I started at BYU–Idaho, I never would have guessed that a few beginner coding classes would spark a passion for computer science. Each class deepened my curiosity and drive, leading me to officially change my major to Computer Science—and I’ve loved every minute of the journey.

Alongside my studies, I’ve built two years of professional experience in customer service, where I developed strong communication, problem-solving, and client relations skills. These experiences give me a unique perspective: I enjoy not only solving technical problems, but also connecting with people and explaining solutions in a clear, approachable way.

I also serve as the Scrum Master for the BYU–Idaho Data Science Society, where I facilitate Agile workflows, coordinate projects, and ensure that our team stays focused and collaborative. This role has strengthened my leadership, organizational, and communication abilities while giving me hands-on experience applying Agile methodologies in real-world projects.

Outside of school and work, I love exploring new ideas and keeping life balanced. You’ll usually find me hiking, spending time with my two cats 🐾, relaxing with a cozy game of Stardew Valley, or practicing Spanish. I also love experimenting with small “sandbox” websites on my computer — personal projects that let me test new coding techniques and push my creativity as a developer.
